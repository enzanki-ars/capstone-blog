### Expectations

__Why did you choose this experience?__  
I knew the project would provide me with some valuable experience making dynamic web applications like it, as well as creating something useful.

__What new knowledge or new experiences did you hope to gain from this experience?__  
For a project like this, it can be hard to tell exactly what I could learn; there are a large number of ways that the project can go. The main experience I knew I would get was to take the project from start to finish.

__How did you think you would benefit from your involvement?__  
I knew creating the webapp would be an interesting experience, but I also have a good use for a project like this; something to search for options and expose data about each college would greatly benefit my own college search.

### Reflection

__Explain how your experience affected you as a person? How did you change? How do you see the world differently than you did before?__  
I wouldn't say that the experience drastically changed my worldview, but it definitely gave me a new appreciation for how complex it can be to make a web application from start to finish. I also learned that programming isn't always about the fun parts; a few times, I had to spend a while fixing a bug, looking at the application's error logs, and still not figuring it out until I realized I had made a small mistake or conflicting change.

__Was this a meaningful experience? Why or why not?__  
Yes, it was. I ended up gaining more experience than I expected, and learning useful things about the world of software engineering.

__What new knowledge or skills did you learn from this experience?__  
For one thing, I learned how to use the Go programming language, and the web application server that comes with it. I also learned how to use [first-class functions](http://jacobsims.github.io/capstone-blog/blog/2015/10/07/first-class-functions.html) for filtering and sorting the colleges.

__How would you do it differently if you had to start over?__  
I don't know that I'd make a whole lot of changes. Really, the only thing I would do is structure the project differently. Because I didn't take much time to plan it, I ended up with less separation of concerns than I had hoped for. Ideally, each part of the project would have its own package and, if necessary, be separated into multiple files. For a small project, what I did wasn't a completely bad choice, but the use of multiple packages would allow for better separation of concerns.
