To start off my capstone project, I created this blog. If you're reading this, that means it's probably working.

This blog was created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is GitHub's free web hosting provider. GitHub Pages is nice because I can use the tools I am familiar with for software development (like `git`). The main drawback of GitHub Pages is that it only supports static sites. To make it easier on the server, static sites are created only once, and the same pages are served to everyone who loads them. Dynamic sites are the opposite; they generate their content differently depending on what the user is doing. My actual project will be a dynamic site, because it has to analyze, sort, and present the data to you in different ways depending on your selections. To generate this static site, I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is integrated with GitHub Pages to make things even easier.

On here I'll post about what I'm doing, problems I'm trying to fix, and general interesting information about the project or the technologies I'm using to build it.
