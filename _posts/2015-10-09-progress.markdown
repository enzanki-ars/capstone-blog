It's about time that I post a status update (I haven't done one yet because it's more fun just to work on the project).

Here's a screenshot of the app as it currently stands:

There is still some work left to do, but the basic functionality and styling is all there.

Right now, you can:

- Filter the colleges by their names
- Choose how to sort them (by ACT or tuition price)
- Filter by the main degree they give (bachelor's or associate's degrees)
- Filter by the state they are located in

The next things I plan to do are:

- Allow matching by acronym for searches (for example, searching for "osu" will match "Ohio State University")
- Improve data display for each college (right now, it only shows price and average ACT)
- Give each college its own webpage, so you can see even more information about it
- Split the results into pages so the page isn't too big

Hopefully, when I'm done, the app will be useful for anyone trying to find the college that best fits them.
