I am making the webapp project using [Go](https://golang.org), a modern compiled language. It's great for making webapps; for my project, I'm using the HTTP server and templating engine from the standard library.

Go has a good balance between being easy to write and fast to run. It doesn't have as many features as a language like Python, but it is much faster.
